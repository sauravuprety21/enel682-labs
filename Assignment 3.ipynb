    "1. Compared to linear models, the results are worse. Although the training R2 scores are much better for the non linear methods, 0.823, 0.881, 0.986 for decision trees, random forest, and gradient boost machines, respectively, compared to 0.611 for linear regression. The validatioon scores for the non-linear methods are significantly lower - 0.176, 0.173, 0.474 (decision trees, random forest, gradient boost machines) compared to 0.623 for linear regression. Similar trends are observed for the mean squared error. This discrepancy is most likely due to the differences in training size, and the inability to non-linear methods to extrapolate. Since cross-validation is used, with the default value of 5 folds. The training size for each cross-validation step is much smaller compared to the training size of the linear regression dataset (20 % comapred to 75 %). Hence, the models are in the high-variance region (left) of the learning curve. Finally, the tree-based regression methods have limited ability to extrapolate beyond their training dataset, this coupled with the limited training dataset could explain the discrepancy between the validation and training accuracies.\n",
    "2. Out of the models, I would use GBM for this dataset. GBM has the best perforamce, 0.990 and 0.474 training and test accuracies, respectively. GBM can also be highly tuned with the learning rate and n estimators parameters. \n",

Write the code below to test three different scaling methods, `MinMaxScaler`, `StandardScaler` and `RobustScaler`. For this case, use the same cross-validation method mentioned in the previous step. Print the training and validation accuracy results in a table. Use the default parameters for the `SVC`. "

This is because, predicting with tree-based methods requires just going through an if-elseif ladder, where as prediciting with SVM requires computation of distances support vectors which is computationally more expensive.  Tree-based methods, with reasonable pre-pruned depth, like GBM, can be visualize and easily communicated to provide an intuitive understanding, however, SVM is not the same. "
